# SansMobile003

This repository contains a Vue 3 + Vite + Capacitor mobile application for Sans Reserve.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The UI is built with Tailwind CSS and always renders inside a fixed mobile frame for consistent layout across devices.


## API Configuration

All base URLs and endpoint paths are defined in `src/config/api.ts` so they can be easily updated without touching the service logic.
